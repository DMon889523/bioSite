        <h1>About Shanique Hordge</h1>
        <p>
            Shanique Hordge, at the age of 28, stands as an educated and articulate individual, currently serving as a director for Catholic Charities. Balancing her professional commitments, she is a few hours away from completing her master’s degree—a testament 
          to her commitment to continuous learning. Shanique is dedicated to her career and being a loving mother and a doting fiancée. Her role as the cornerstone of her family is evident in the values she upholds and the love she shares with her 
          close ones.
